## ML Examples
This is the code I wrote learning machine learning on the Facebook Pytorch Challenge offered [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd188/) on [Udacity](ssroom.udacity.com/me).

## Need the code?
Fork or clone it. No problem

## What you will Need
1. Python 3.6 (that's what I used :blush:)
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Pytorch
5. TorchVision (_pip install torchvision_ will install both torchvision and pytorch :smile:)
